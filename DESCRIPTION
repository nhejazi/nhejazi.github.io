Description: A minimal website listing my various software projects. The primary
    purpose of this website is to link to the documentation and supporting
    materials of software projects in which I have been involved. Most of these
    projects have self-contained sites (built via R's `pkgdown`) hosted under
    this site. Links to the individual software websites are provided via the
    documentation of functions in this R package. As an R package, this site
    also allows all of the R packages that I've authored/co-authored to be
    conveniently installed simply, as a side effect of installing this package.
