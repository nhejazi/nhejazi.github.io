#' biotmle R package: Targeted Learning with moderated statistics for biomarker discovery
#'
#' This package facilitates the discovery of biomarkers from biological
#' sequencing data (e.g., microarrays, RNA-seq) based on the associations of
#' potential biomarkers with exposure and outcome variables by implementing an
#' estimation procedure that combines a generalization of moderated statistics
#' with targeted minimum loss-based estimates (TMLE) of causal parameters
#' (e.g., Average Treatment Effect) whose estimators admit asymptotically
#' linear representations (in terms of influence functions).
