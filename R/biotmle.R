#' biotmle R package: Moderated and Targeted Statistical Learning for Biomarker Discovery
#'
#' This package facilitates the discovery of biomarkers from biological
#' sequencing data (e.g., microarrays, RNA-seq) based on the associations of
#' potential biomarkers with exposure and outcome variables by implementing an
#' estimation procedure that combines a generalization of moderated statistics
#' with targeted minimum loss-based estimates (TMLE) of parameters defined via
#' causal inference (e.g., Average Treatment Effect) whose estimators admit
#' asymptotically linear representations.
