#' methyvim R package: Targeted Variable Importance for Differential Methylation Analysis
#'
#' This package provides facilities for differential methylation analysis based
#' on variable importance measures (VIMs), a class of statistical target
#' parameters that arise in causal inference. The estimation and inference
#' procedures provided are nonparametric, relying on ensemble machine learning
#' to flexibly assess functional relationships among covariates and the outcome
#' of interest. These tools can be applied to differential methylation at the
#' level of CpG sites, to obtain valid statistical inference even after
#' corrections for multiple hypothesis testing.
