#' txshift R package: Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation of the Causal Effect of Stochastic Interventions and Variable Importance Analysis
#'
#' Facilities for computing targeted maximum likelihood estimates of
#' population-level causal effects of continuous-valued interventions defined by
#' stochastic assignment mechanisms. To handle applications with censored data
#' (i.e., two-stage designs), an inverse probability of censoring weighted
#' (IPCW) targeted maximum likelihood estimator for the stochastic treatment
#' shift parameter is implemented as well.
