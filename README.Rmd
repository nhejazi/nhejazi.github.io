# Nima's code

> support materials and documentation for my software and miscellaneous code

This page contains no unique or useful information. If you're here, you're
probably looking instead for support materials of software I've written ---
usually hosted at http://code.nimahejazi.org/PKG, where "PKG" should be replaced
with the name of a specific software package of interest.

Since you've wound up here, you might also be interested in

## Installation

Similar in spirit to the [`tidyverse` R package](), `code.nima`, the R package
found here, can be used to conveniently install all of the R packages I've
(co-)authored as a side effect of installing this (mostly empty) package from
GitHub using [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):


```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/nhejazi.github.io")
```
